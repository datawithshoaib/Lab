This code implements **Level Order Traversal** (also known as **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**) of a binary tree, using an **iterative approach** with a **queue** data structure. In BFS, nodes are visited level by level from left to right.

```python
# Python program to print level
# order traversal using Queue

class Node:
    def __init__(self, key):
        self.data = key
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

# Iterative Method to print the
# height of a binary tree
def printLevelOrder(root):
    # Base Case
    if root is None:
        return

    # Create an empty queue
    # for level order traversal
    queue = []

    # Enqueue Root and initialize height
    queue.append(root)

    while(len(queue) > 0):
        # Print front of queue and
        # remove it from queue
        print(queue[0].data, end=" ")
        node = queue.pop(0)

        # Enqueue left child
        if node.left is not None:
            queue.append(node.left)

        # Enqueue right child
        if node.right is not None:
            queue.append(node.right)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    root = Node(1)
    root.left = Node(2)
    root.right = Node(3)
    root.left.left = Node(4)
    root.left.right = Node(5)
    printLevelOrder(root)

```

### Let's break it down:

1. **Node Class**:
   ```python
   class Node:
       def __init__(self, key):
           self.data = key
           self.left = None
           self.right = None
   ```
   - This class defines a node in a binary tree.
   - Each `Node` object has:
     - `data`: stores the value (key) of the node.
     - `left`: a pointer to the left child of the node.
     - `right`: a pointer to the right child of the node.
   - Initially, both the `left` and `right` children are `None` (empty).

2. **printLevelOrder Function**:
   ```python
   def printLevelOrder(root):
   ```
   This function implements the BFS traversal using a queue.

3. **Base Case Check**:
   ```python
   if root is None:
       return
   ```
   - If the root node is `None` (i.e., the tree is empty), the function returns immediately. This prevents errors from trying to traverse an empty tree.

4. **Queue Initialization**:
   ```python
   queue = []
   queue.append(root)
   ```
   - The function initializes an empty list called `queue`. This will be used to store the nodes we need to visit (process) in the correct order.
   - The root node is added (enqueued) to the queue first.

5. **Iterative Loop**:
   ```python
   while(len(queue) > 0):
   ```
   - This `while` loop runs as long as there are nodes in the queue.
   - It ensures that we keep processing nodes until the queue is empty, i.e., all nodes have been visited.

6. **Processing Nodes**:
   ```python
   print(queue[0].data, end=" ")
   node = queue.pop(0)
   ```
   - The first node in the queue (`queue[0]`) is the node we want to process.
   - The `print(queue[0].data, end=" ")` prints the value of the current node.
     - `end=" "` ensures that the nodes are printed on the same line, separated by a space.
   - After printing, we remove this node from the queue using `queue.pop(0)` and assign it to the variable `node`.

7. **Enqueue Left Child**:
   ```python
   if node.left is not None:
       queue.append(node.left)
   ```
   - If the left child of the current node (`node.left`) exists (i.e., it is not `None`), we enqueue it (add it to the queue). This ensures that the left child will be processed in subsequent iterations of the loop.

8. **Enqueue Right Child**:
   ```python
   if node.right is not None:
       queue.append(node.right)
   ```
   - Similarly, if the right child of the current node (`node.right`) exists, we enqueue it to the queue.

### Example of Execution:

In the `__main__` block:
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    root = Node(1)
    root.left = Node(2)
    root.right = Node(3)
    root.left.left = Node(4)
    root.left.right = Node(5)
    printLevelOrder(root)
```

The binary tree created is:

```
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \
    4   5
```

1. **Initialization**:
   - The queue starts with just the root node `[1]`.

2. **First iteration**:
   - `1` is processed: it is dequeued and printed.
   - The left child `2` and right child `3` are enqueued.
   - Queue after this iteration: `[2, 3]`.

3. **Second iteration**:
   - `2` is processed: it is dequeued and printed.
   - Its children `4` and `5` are enqueued.
   - Queue after this iteration: `[3, 4, 5]`.

4. **Third iteration**:
   - `3` is processed: it is dequeued and printed.
   - `3` has no children, so nothing is enqueued.
   - Queue after this iteration: `[4, 5]`.

5. **Fourth iteration**:
   - `4` is processed: it is dequeued and printed.
   - `4` has no children.
   - Queue after this iteration: `[5]`.

6. **Fifth iteration**:
   - `5` is processed: it is dequeued and printed.
   - `5` has no children.
   - Queue after this iteration: `[]` (empty).

At this point, the queue is empty, and the traversal is complete.

### Output:

The program will print:
```
1 2 3 4 5
```
This is the level order traversal of the tree (BFS), where nodes are visited level by level from top to bottom and from left to right within each level.

### Key Concept: **Queue-based BFS**
- A queue ensures that nodes are processed in the order they were discovered, which is critical for BFS. Nodes are processed level by level, and children of each node are enqueued so they can be processed after their parent.
